Hill-Climbing Algorithm in 2D Search Space
    - Greepy Approach
    - Simple Hill-Climbing

1. Evaluate initial state to see if it is the goal state
    - Goal State: Gradient doesn't change or bound is reached
    - If not, make initial state the current state
2. Loop until solution state are reached or resources are exhausted
    a. Select a non-discovered state 
    b. Evaluate new state
        i. If goal, stop
        ii. if better, make current and continue
        iii. If not better, continue loop auntil solution is found
